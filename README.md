# Dinner Party
Dinner Party is an application to share cooking experiences with friends and family.
Also with Dinner Party you can get help by a professional chef. 

Dinner Party uses Eyeson to make video calls between everyone at your dinner table or in your kitchen.

## Inspiration
As citizens across the globe are being asked to stay at home, more and more people are experiencing heightened levels of anxiety and loneliness. Cooking and sharing meals together is a key aspect of staying connected and helps alleviate these pressures. Dinner party was created to:
- Reduce the social distance (without reducing the physical)
- Help people to get new ideas and better/healthier food
- Let people reflect on what they need to buy
- Provide a communication channel for social cooking/eating

## What it does
Virtual dinner parties. Collaborative learning. Improving skills with the help of professionals. Dinner Party is a platform that facilitates cooking and dining sessions with friends and family and allows participants to be taught by professional chefs without leaving their kitchen.
- To plan a Dinner Party, open the app and instantly connect with friends, or other party-goers.
- You can keep the Dinner Party simple, but if you want to kick it up a notch and learn new skills, you can ask a professional to give you and your guests a cooking class!
- A few days before the class, you'll receive the list of ingredients that are required for the dish you're going to make.

## How we built it
We built it from 2 perspectives, the guest's perspective and the chef's perspective. Our tech team created a prototype for the app, while our marketing team created a website and social media accounts.

## Challenges we ran into
- Getting started! We are such a creative team; everyone had a lot of original and useful ideas!
- The project is quite ambitious, and there were many solutions to find,
- Technical issues: the app gave our tech team a hard time, but we're all grateful they worked even harder to make the prototype!

## Accomplishments that we are proud of
- Being an agile team: getting along and organized so fast, as we barely knew each other before the hackathon
- Finding a solution to the isolation issue
- Our register of cooking jokes on Google Drive
- Setting up our social media accounts makes it real, for us, but also for other people who might want to reach out soon!

## What we learned
- Some of us have weird sleeping schedules
- Collaboration is key! And we were provided with good tools (Slack, Miro, Zoom, ...)
- It's important to find an organization pretty fast, find a leader, subdivide the work between smaller groups...

## What's next for Dinner Party
- Developping Tech + website
- Business case and monetization
- Finding guests and chefs
- Donation and sponsoring
- Expand to local farming and shops
- Adding features and integrations: detailed user profiles, a community feed, nutritional information on the recipes from dietitians. Ingredient-based recipe search function. Ingredient substitution option for more flexibility
